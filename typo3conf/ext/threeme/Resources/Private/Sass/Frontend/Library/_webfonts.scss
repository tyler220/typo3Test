/*!
 * HOWTO - Working with the SASS structure
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * #1: Main structure
 * ./Extensions/: SASS partials for TYPO3 extensions you use in your website.
 * ./Frontend/Components/: SASS patterns intended to be used across the site. Pretty much everything in here will be devoted a section in the live style guide.
 * ./Frontend/Library/: Contains only variables and mixins SASS that does not render any actual CSS, but is used later.
 * ./Frontend/Sections/: Layouts and other page-specific stylings. Anything that is not intended to be used in multiple places in a versatile way.
 * ./Vendor/: Vendor libraries in subfolders with SASS container files on top. Uncomment features in container as you need them, when your user stories demand the functionality.
 * ./styles-*.scss: The SASS container files which are compiled to native CSS.
 * ./config.rb: Configuration file for compass, if you want to complie your SASS on your own instead of using third party extensions like "dyncss".
 *
 *
 * #2: SASS container and partials
 * - Uncomment features in vendor container or in the compiling SASS files as you need them, when your user stories demand the functionality.
 * - If you need to add a new or modify a (vendor) partial, create a new one in "Components" or "Sections" and include it in the compiling SASS file.
